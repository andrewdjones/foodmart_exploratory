# foodmart_exploratory
Code base for business analysis of "foodmart"

#Rough plan
1. Build some my_sql tables in case others need to use the data for lookups and for speedy exploratory queries (foodmart_mysql_explo.py)
2. Use numpy, scipy, scikit-learn to get some rudimentary stats about the data (product_cats_brands.py)
3. Use matplotlib to produce some visualizations displaying the stats (foodmart_viz.py)
